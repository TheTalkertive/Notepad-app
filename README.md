# To-Do List
_This is just to demonstrate my skills and ability to style the front end of an application. There is no functionality attached to this application, it is pure css and a little of javascript to insert inputs dynamically into the DOM._

### _ABOUT APPLICATION_
---

_I built this application to demonstrate my understanding and experience with the following techniques and technologies:_

* DOM Manupulation & Traversing
* BOOTSTRAP 
* CSS 
* HTML
* JAVASCRIPT

#### NB: Although effort was put into writing this code to be as clean and dry as possible, some sections of code will definitely need to be refactored in order to be production ready. This is purely for demo purposes.
